# odin-recipes

My first website project with The Odin Project

Up to this point in The Odin Project, I've learned some basic Unix commands, a bit about Git, Github, and now very recently some basic HTML. This is will be a demonstration of what I've learned so far. 

This project's goal is to create a basic recipe website with the knowledge and skills I've accrued thus far.
