        <div class="description">
            <p>With over 4,000 5-star reviews, this classic French beef stew is the all-time most popular recipe on my
                website.
                It is the ultimate cold weather comfort food. Chunks of well-marbled beef are seared in a hot pan, then
                gently
                braised with garlic and onions in a rich wine-based broth. After a few hours in the oven, the meat
                becomes
                meltingly tender and enveloped in a deeply flavorful sauce. It takes a few hours to make, but the recipe
                is
                mostly hands-off. Go ahead and make it a day or two ahead of time; the flavor improves the longer it
                sits.
